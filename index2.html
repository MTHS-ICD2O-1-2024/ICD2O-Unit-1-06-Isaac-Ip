          <p>Five Nights at Freddy's (FNaF) is a video game series and media franchise created by indie game developer Scott Cawthon.
          The franchise features ten main video games, several spin-off games, novels, and a film adaptation.
          
          The video game series follows a set of night guards and other characters that try to survive from midnight to 6 a.m. for
          five levels, called "nights", while fending off attacks from homicidal animatronic characters. Each game is set in a
          different location connected to a fictional family pizza restaurant franchise named "Freddy Fazbear's Pizza". The core
          gameplay mechanic involves using tools effectively and managing limited resources to avoid being caught by the
          animatronics.
          
          Cawthon conceived the idea for the first video game after his family-friendly resource management game, Chipper & Sons
          Lumber Co., was criticized for the resemblance of its characters to frightening animatronics. Responding to this
          feedback, he developed a horror game that intentionally featured scary animatronics. Released in August 2014, the game's
          success prompted the development of sequels. Cawthon created most of the games himself using Clickteam Fusion but
          partnered with Steel Wool Studios to create an open-world game and a virtual reality anthology.
          
          The series has a mixed critical reception, with praise for its storytelling and atmosphere but criticism for its
          gameplay. It has achieved significant commercial success, with merchandise available internationally. The franchise has
          also garnered a cult following that produces fan media inspired by it.</p>
